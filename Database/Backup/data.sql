It’s made with pantry staples, and it’s super speedy and easy to whip up (no electric mixer required here). I hope it will become a staple in your household as a perfect any day treat. \n\nI love a slice of this pound cake with my beloved morning coffee. It also satisfies my after-dinner sweets craving. Recently, I poked a few (yes, just a few!) candles on top to celebrate my chocolate-loving mother’s birthday. I will be baking it over and over again.\n\nBefore you rush off to preheat your oven, I want to share a few things I learned that will help you bake the best chocolate pound cake ever.  	Salat	t

Set aside.\n    Mix together the tomato topping for Cheesy Bruschetta Chicken Cutlets\n    Sear the chicken:\n\n    Season the chicken cutlets on both sides with the salt and pepper.\n\n    Heat the olive oil in a large (12-inch), oven-safe skillet over medium high heat. I like to use either a cast iron or stainless steel skillet -- nonstick and enameled cast iron cookware usually aren't meant to be used above 500oF, so they aren’t broiler safe.\n\n    When the oil is shimmering, sear the chicken cutlets for 3 minutes on one side, just so they get a little bit of color.\n\n    It’s ok if they are not cooked through, since they will finish cooking in the oven.\n    Sear the chicken cutlets in a pan.\n    Flip and season the cutlets:\n\n    Flip the cutlets over, then spoon on the bruschetta topping and sprinkle with the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Let them cook in the pan for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n    Finish searing the chicken on the stovetop\n    Top the chicken with tomato bruschetta topping\n    Top the chicken with tomato bruschetta topping and cheese\n    Broil the chicken:\n\n    Place the skillet under the broiler. Broil until the cheese is bubbly and brown and the chicken is cooked through, about 3 minutes.\n\n    Check for doneness by cutting into one of the cutlets to see if it’s opaque in the center, or by checking the temperature of one of the cutlets with an instant-read thermometer (the chicken should be 165oF or higher in the center).\n\n    At this point, your chicken should be ready, but if you used cutlets that were thicker than 1/4-inch you may have to return it to the stovetop to cook for another 1-3 minutes.

183	4	50	2	2022-05-23	60	Kulebyaka with meat is a closed oblong-shaped Russian pie cooked on a soft and fluffy yeast dough. Previously, kulebyaka was necessarily baked with a complex filling, consisting of several tiers. And so that the products do not mix, thin pancakes were used as layers.\n\nNow, according to the old technology, kulebyaka is rarely prepared. In order to save time, housewives usually take only 1-2 ingredients for the filling. It can be meat, fish, vegetables, etc. There are no rigid frames and strict borders here - you can cook a cake with any filler! In our example, consider a simple recipe for kulebyaki with minced meat.	Chic kulebyaka	t

59	18	27	2	2022-05-17	60	Sift 5 cups (cup capacity 250 ml) of flour onto a board. Add margarine at room temperature and chop with a knife into more or less homogeneous crumbs. I prefer to first cut the margarine into pieces, and then rub it with my hands, it turns out faster and the crumb is more uniform.\nGradually pouring in 1 glass of milk, quickly knead the dough. It turns out greasy, does not stick to the hands and the board. I must say that in no case should you knead the dough for "Napoleon" for a long time, otherwise the dough will "tighten" when rolling out.\nDivide the dough in half and cut each part into 7 pieces (14 pieces in total). Roll out very thin. The dough is very grateful, it rolls out easily and does not tear. There is no need to wind it up with a rolling pin. Transfer the dough to a clean, dry baking sheet, flatten.\nCut, prick with a fork. I took the bottom from a detachable form with a diameter of 28 cm. Bake at 200 * C until golden brown. It bakes very quickly, literally 5-7 minutes. You have to be careful not to overdo it. Remove very carefully with a wide knife, the cakes are very fragile ...\nHere we have such a stack of cakes ...\n\n\nScatter the scraps on a baking sheet and bake until light brown. When the scraps have cooled, grind them into large crumbs. I just rub my hands.\n\nNow let's start making the cream. 3 yolks grind with 3 tbsp. l. white sugar, add 3 tbsp. l. flour. Mix. Dilute with a small amount of milk, taken from the norm for 2 creams, to a jelly mass.\n\nBoil the remaining milk (only 0.5 l) and pour into the mass, stirring. Boil. Cool down. Whip the butter with 2 cups of sugar. Add the custard one tablespoon at a time and beat on medium speed until smooth each time. It is necessary to act carefully, because if you throw a lot of custard at once, the general cream can exfoliate.\n\nThe cream is very fluffy, soft and airy. Coat the cakes with a THIN layer of cream and put them in a pile. Chop up the scraps and sprinkle on top. Leave some crumbs.\n\nThis is what our cake will look like after spreading the cakes. He's a bit of an ass.\n\nCover with a board and carefully place a small oppression on top. I have a 2 liter kettle with water. So leave it overnight. Remove the load in the morning. The cake will settle. Fluff the top slightly with a fork. The cream will squeeze out a little on the sides, smear it and sprinkle the sides with crumbs.\nThat's it! This is my Napoleon. We love this cake, especially my husband. All the time he asks me to cook it, but for the family I cook it very rarely. I cooked for myself for my 40th birthday, and then for my husband’s 55th birthday (and we have been with him since the same year) ...\nThis is what it looks like cutaway. Do you believe there are 14 cakes here?\nHooray!!! Hooray!!! I learned how to enlarge photos! Girls, thanks for the help! Hooray!!!	Napoleon cake	t
